# MSVC, Building a library

### Using libraries and why it matters.

**Wikipedia** : "The value of a library lies in the reuse of standardized program elements. When a program invokes a library, it gains the behavior implemented inside that library without having to implement that behavior itself. Libraries encourage the sharing of code in a modular fashion and ease the distribution of the code."
